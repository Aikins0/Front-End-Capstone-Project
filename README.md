# My Front End Capstone Project

Project scenario
The Capstone project at the center of this course is based on a scenario involving the restaurant Little Lemon. In particular, the owners of Little Lemon have received negative feedback on the reserve a table function on the Little Lemon website. Users are confused about how to use it and unhappy with how it looks and functions. That's where you come in. In this course, you will learn how to build a responsive web app and demonstrate multiple skills by coding a modern front end application that allows users to reserve a table for the Little Lemon restaurant. You will be guided through the process of building the app, combining all the skills and technologies you've learned throughout this program to solve the problem at hand.
